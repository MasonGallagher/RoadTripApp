# **Group 5 - Road Trip App Project**

## Project Description

For our group project, we were tasked with creating a system that allows a user to plan a road trip. This system must allow many destinations to be added (And removed) these must then be scheduled to give the best route and timings for the trip. This system must also recommend/ show attractions and hotels that are near each destination. Conditions such as traffic, overnight stays and other circumstances must be taken into account when scheduling the road trip. 

For this this system we decided to implement it for Android mobile devices, as it is one of the most common platforms for mobile systems. We decided to use this platform rather others such as iOS or web as a dedicated mobile application gives us as developers a lot more control compared with web based systems. However, we decided on Android rather than iOS as it's a lot easier to develop on Android rather than iOS.
